# Project Title
Educational Content Enhancement for learning and engagement Using LLMs

# Project Description 
This project is a web application designed to modify educational PDFs based on the learner type by taking the extracted text of the PDF and sending it to **"llama-3.1-70b"** (using Groq API) along with a background prompt. Additionally, it features a conversational AI with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot (using LangChain, "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5" as the embedding model from FastEmbed, FAISS for vector storing and "BAAI/bge-reranker-base" as the reranker model for the retrieved data) that allows users to interact with the PDF content. Finally, the application includes a quiz generation system and an instant evaluation feature to enhance interactive learning.
